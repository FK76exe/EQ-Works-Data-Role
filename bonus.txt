- scale is -10 to 10 (range = 20)

I chose the densities from q3 since it shows how popular the POI was in its surroundings.

I represented the average as a 0 and the 0-10 range the higher of the following 2 values:
    1. | maximum value - average |
    2. | minimum value - average |
this allows for all values to fit on the scale.
To convert the raw values to a scale of -10 to 10, I needed to create a coefficient.
The coefficient I created came out of this equation:
    (average + range) - (average - range) / 20 = (2*range) / 20 = range/10
    20 was used as it was the absolute difference of the end points (| -10 - 10 | = 20)
for each density I subtracted the average from it and divided it with the coefficient, 
to calculate where it would lay on the -10 -> 10 scale.
